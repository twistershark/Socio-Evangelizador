## Screenshots:

#### This project helps a donor on signing up in your non-profit donation plan. After they complete the form, they'll start receiving monthly links on their emails to donate their choosen value to your organization. 
##### This project utilizes ViaCep API to fill out all the address fields after the donor enters his postal code. All payments are generated using PagSeguro's  Boleto API.

## Getting Started

This project was developed using what I learned during the NLW, a bootcamp provided by Rocketseat that taught how to develop using the Node and React stack. 

The following instructions will get you a copy of the app up and running on your local machine. 

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

__NodeJS__ (Version 12 or newer)

## How to execute the project

#### Back-end:
First of all, you need to be running the server in order to create new donors. Just navigate to the _server_ folder with your terminal and execute: ```npm install``` to install every dependency, then execute the following command to start the server: ```npm run dev```.

#### Web:
Enter __web__  folder and execute the following commands:
1. ```npm install``` (Installs every dependency needed)
2. ```npm start```


## Built With

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - designed to build scalable network applications
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
